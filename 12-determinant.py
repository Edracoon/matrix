What is the inverse of a matrix?

    The inverse of a matrix A-1 is another matrix such that
    multiplying A by its inverse gives the identity matrix:

    A^-1 * A=In

    where:
        A is an n * n square matrix.
        In is the identity matrix of the same size.
        A^-1 exists only if A is invertible.

What does the inverse represent?

    -> Reversibility: If A represents a transfo, A^-1 reverses that transfo.
    -> Scaling Factor: Changes in volume/area due to AA are undone by A^-1.
    -> Solving Equations: It gives a formula for solving matrix equations.

Determinant Connection:

    A matrix is invertible if and only if det(A) â‰  0.
    If det(A) = 0, the matrix is singular, meaning it has no inverse.

Rank Connection:

    A full-rank matrix (rank = n) is invertible.
    If the rank of A is less than n, it means its rows/columns are
    linearly dependent, making AA singular (non-invertible).
