"""
            Trace of a matrix

The trace of a square matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements.

If A is an n by n matrix:

    trace(A) = a11 + a22 + ... + ann

Where Aii are the diagonal elements (where row index = column index).
The trace is only defined for square matrices.

Example:
    A = [1, 2, 3]
        [4, 5, 6]
        [7, 8, 9]

    trace(A) = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15

1. Used in Machine Learning and Physics

Invariance: The trace doesnâ€™t change under certain transformations.
Quantum Mechanics: Used to describe quantum states.

2. Indicates Matrix Properties

If trace = 0, the matrix is traceless.
If trace is large, it gives information about the sum of its diagonal elements.
